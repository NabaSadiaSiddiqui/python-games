Read along for a brief description of each game:  
* Stopwatch: The Game  
This is a simple digital stopmwatch accurate to the tenths of a second. It has 3 buttons: "Start", "Stop" and "Reset". It also keeps track of the number of times that the watch is stopped on a whole second, out of the number of successful stops.  
* Pong  
This is a version of the 1972 arcade video game "Pong"  
* Memory  
This is a computer version of the card game "Memory"  
* Blackjack  
This is a **simplified** version of the casino game "Blackjack". As described on the Rice University course "An Introduction to Interacive Programming in Python", the rules of this modified version of the game are as follows:  
The player and the dealer are each dealt two cards initially with one of the dealer's cards being dealt faced down (his hole card). The player may then ask for the dealer to repeatedly "hit" his hand by dealing him another card. If, at any point, the value of the player's hand exceeds 21, the player is "busted" and loses immediately. At any point prior to busting, the player may "stand" and the dealer will then hit his hand until the value of his hand is 17 or more. (For the dealer, aces count as 11 unless it causes the dealer's hand to bust). If the dealer busts, the player wins. Otherwise, the player and dealer then compare the values of their hands and the hand with the higher value wins. The dealer wins ties in this version.  
* Asteroids  
This is an updated version of the 1979 video game "Asteroids"
